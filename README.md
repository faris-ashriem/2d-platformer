# 2D-Platformer  



This game was built by a team of four people, where we had 24 hours to try and create the best game possible.  

This project was built entirely in **Godot** using **GDScript.**
  
The design theme that we were given was **Cyberpunk**.  
  
The gameplay mechanic theme was **"You Only Get One ___".**  

Our team decided on to base our game around "You Only Get One Bullet".  

We built a 2D platformer game which earned 2nd place in this event!
